# PROBABILITY

## Trial and Event:

Let an experiment be repeated , under the same conditions as the result of the several possible out comes. The experiment is called as trial and the possible outcomes are called events or cases.

-Tossing of a coin is a trial and turning up of head or tail is an event
-Throwing a die is a trial and getting 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 is an event

### Exhaustive events: 

The total no of all possible outcomes in any trial is known as exhaustive events.
**Ex(1)**: In tossing a coin, there are two exhausive cases, i.e. head or tail 
**Ex(2)**: In tossing a dice, there are six exhausitive cases

### Favourable Events:
The cases which entail (considerable risk) the happening of an event are said to be favourable events.
**EX**: When we through the two dices the no. of favourable of getting a sum of 6 is 5:
(1,5),(5,1)(2,4)(4,2)(3,3)

### Mutually Exclusive Events:
No two or more than two of them can happen simultaneously in the same trial.
**EX(1)**:In a tossing a coin can either the head will come or tail. If the head will come, the possibility of getting tail in the same trial is ruled out.
**EX(2)**:In throwing a dice all 6 faces numbered 1,2,3,4,5,6 are mutually exclusive since any outcome rules out the possibility of getting other.

## Random Experiment:

Occurences which can be repeated a number of times, essentially under the same conditions and whose result cannot be predicted before are known as random experiment.
**EX**: rolling of a dice, tossing a coin, taking out balls from a bag.

## Sample Space:

The set of all these possible outcomes is called the sample space for the particular experiment and is denoted by an 's'.

If a coin is tossed and Head and Tail denote with H and T respectfully then the sample space is:

	S={H,T}

Where there are two sample points H and T. S={1,2,3,4,5,6}. In case of coin there are six sample points.

### Finite Sample Space: 

If the no of sample points in a sample space is finite, we call it a finite sample space.

Note: 

	S⊆S; where S itself is an event
	Φ⊆S; the null set is also an event

## Axiomatic Approach

'Axioms' are statements which one reasonably true and accepted as such without seeking any proof.
**Definition:** Let S be the sample space associated with a random experiment . Let A be any event in S, then P(A) is the probability of occurence of A if the following axioms are satisfied.

	P(A)>0; where A is any event
	P(S)=1; P(A)+P(B)+....+P(n)=1
	P(AUB)=P(A)+P(B); when event A and B are mutually exclusive.
