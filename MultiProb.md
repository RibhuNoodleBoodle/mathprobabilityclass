# Multiplication Law of Probability

- The probability of simultaneous occurence of two events for A and B

	P(A⋂B)= P(A)xP(B|A)
	P(AB)=P(A)xP(B|A)

- The above equation can be interchanged 

	P(AB)=P(A)xP(B|A)
	When Interchanged with each other:
	P(BA)=P(B)xP(A|B)
	P(AB)=P(B)xP(A|B) [Since, B⋂A=A⋂B]

- If A and B are independednt events, then 

	P(B|A)=P(B)
	P(AB)=P(A)xP(B)

General Soultion: If (A1, A2, A3... An) are n independent events, then P(A1)xP(A2)xP(A3)...P(An)

- If P is the chance that an will happen in one trial then that chance that it will happen in a succession of trials.

P.P.P....P(r times)=P^r

-If P1, P2, ... Pn are the probabilities that contain events happen then the probabilities are:

(1-Pn)(1-P2) ... (1-Pn)

Hence, the chance in which atleast one of these event much happen is:

1-(1-P1)(1-P2)(1-P3 )... (1-Pn)
