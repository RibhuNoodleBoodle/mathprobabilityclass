# Multiplication Law of Probability

- The probability of simultaneous occurence of two events for A and B

P(A⋂B)= P(A)xP(B|A)
P(AB)=P(A)xP(B|A)

- The above equation can be interchanged 

P(AB)=P(A)xP(B|A)
When Interchanged with each other:
P(BA)=P(B)xP(A|B)
P(AB)=P(B)xP(A|B) [Since, B⋂A=A⋂B]

- If A and B are independednt events, then 

P(B|A)=P(B)
P(AB)=P(A)xP(B)

General Soultion: If (A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>... A<sub>n</sub>) are n independent events, then P(A<sub>1</sub>)xP(A<sub>2</sub>)xP(A<sub>3</sub>)...P(A<sub>n</sub>)

- If P is the chance that an will happen in one trial then that chance that it will happen in a succession of trials.

P.P.P....P(r times)=P<sup>r</sup>

-If P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, ... P<sub>n</sub> are the probabilities that contain events happen then the probabilities are:

(1-P<sub>1</sub>)(1-P<sub>2</sub>) ... (1-P<sub>n</sub>)

Hence, the chance in which atleast one of these event much happen is:

1-(1-P<sub>1</sub>)(1-P<sub>2</sub>)(1-P<sub>3</sub>)... (1-P<sub>n</sub>)
