# Properties of Probability

- P(A')=1-P(A)
- P(Φ)=0
- If A⊆B then P(A)<=P(B)
- P(AUB)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A⋂B)
- P(A|B)=P(A)-P(A⋂B)

Note: 

- If A and B are mutually disjointed then A⋂B=Φ, so that P(A⋂B)=P(Φ)=0
- P(AUB) is also written as P(A+B). Thus for mutually disjoint events A & B
- If A,B and C are any three events then P(AUBUC)=P(A)+P(B)+P(C)-P(A⋂B)-P(B⋂C)-P(C⋂B)+P(A⋂B⋂C)

# Conditional Probability

Let S be the sample space of any Random experiment are two associated events with S. Then, the conditional probability of the event E if F has occured is denoted by P(E/F) and given by

P(E/F)= ![](http://www.sciweavers.org/download/Tex2Img_1595331404.jpg)
